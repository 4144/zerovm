notes: 
+ check errors codes! i suspect that some original nacl values were changed
  solution: change SRT_NO_SEG_SEL back to 59, shift newly added codes and change
  #define NACL_ERROR_CODE_MAX (SRT_NO_SEG_SEL+1) to the last of a new codes
- "networking" folder will be removed from the project. the code will be split between
  "manifest" and "service_runtime". even more, hopefully, all code will be merged with
  already existing files
- /gtest, /gmock and /sqlite will be moved to the newly created folder "third_party"
  in a future (nearest future) sqlite will be removed
- revise gtest/ and (re)move gtest/data/. it is a bad style to store internal files to
  the third party project.
