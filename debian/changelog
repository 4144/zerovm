zerovm-zmq (0.3) precise; urgency=low

  [ bortoq ]
  * allow user to overload all syscalls except exit and onering (#30 and #3)   design:::::::     main concept is to intercept call from nexe and reroute it to nexe allowing user to handle all syscalls except   onering and exit. interceprion should be made between trampoline and NaClSyscallCSegHook(). most likely it would be   "NaClSyscallSeg" from nacl_syscall_64.S   engine description:::::::     when syscall detected check callstack and read syscall id. if it is not exit/onering and setuplist object contain   syscallback (address provided by user to handle syscalls) - jump to syscallback. user must take care about stack.   security::::::::     main concerns are about syscallback. before adding it to setuplist zvm should very carefully check it for alignement,   target address must be signed "executable", target address must have good enough gap to its "right" border.
  * samples/syscallback test added
  * fixes #003
  * + todo: exit() function added. it can be called via trap() + fix: it is possible now to intercept exit(). interceptor code in "nacl_syscall_64.S" has been changed + fix: refactor ResumeCpuClock()/PauseCpuClock(). to avoid usage not initialized manifest accepted parameter changed from   "struct SetupList*" to "struct NaClApp*" + fix: accounting only work when manifest object is initialized. since zvm still have command string initialization (which   may or may not set manifest) we cannot just use accounting without checks. check for NULL is added. accessor functions   were added for each system/channel counter (can be found in "manifest_setup.c"/"manifest_setup.h") + fix: if nexe file limit was not set zvm exited with error message "nexe file is greater then alowed". now if limit isn't set   zvm skips nexe size check. + fix: if UserLog file isn't exist or has size less than set in given manifest, log will be trimmed to 1 byte or current size   fixed. + test: write test (and wrapper) for user_log engine

  [ camuel ]
  * 2011-09-29 linux, x86, 64 working_sandbox_ver_2.7z version without syscalls --------------------------------------------------------------------------------     2nd version of sandbox. some of syscalls still left untouched because they work in process of load/exit nexe.     without them (or part of them) nexe cannot be loaded and cannot be run (for example we will always get     "segmentation fault" w/o exit syscall)
  * working_sandbox_ver_3 2011-00-30 linux, x86, 64 working_sandbox_ver_3.7z version without syscalls. intermediate version. reduced file list -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	the only difference between this and previous versions is the smaller size of source distribution. 	i managed to remove some needless header files and "sel_main_chrome.c". 	some folders were removed completely with its content: valgrind (since it only needs 	for user nexes), toolchain (same reason). scattered files for windows/osx platforms and arm were removed as well.
  * amend to ver 3
  * ver4 2011-10-8 linux, x86, 64 working_sandbox_ver_4.7z version with optional syscalls and unit tests -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	two main features now are available: 	- new option "-Y" - allow syscalls (by default syscalls restricted to 	SysbrkDecoder, ExitDecoder, Thread_ExitDecoder, 	Tls_InitDecoder, Tls_GetDecoder and null) 	- unit tests. five binaries with several tests each. to extract appropriate test the logger was used (see "3. unittests.txt")
  * ver4.1 2011-10-10
  * ver 4.2 2011-10-20 linux, x86, 64 working_sandbox_ver_4.2.7z command line option "-Y" redesigned. added a new restricted syscalls behavior --------------------------------------------------------------------------------     the "-Y" switch now have options: [0,1,2]. by default "-Y0" assumed even when not specified.     - 0: abort when restricted syscall encountred     - 1: silently ignore restricted syscalls     - 2: allow all syscalls
  * ver5 2011-10-28 linux, x86, 64 working_sandbox_ver_5.7z -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	despite the version number this is an intermediate version. the sandbox is prepared to integrate zmq. 	mock functions implemented. now the file names with "http://" have special meaning - they are a channels. 	proposed user API would be normal "file access" with a special names where the user program can get/set 	the data using standart libc functions (like fread(), fwrite() e.t.c.)
  * ver5.2 2011-11-8 linux, x86, 64 working_sandbox_ver_5.2.7z added manifest, command line switches were revised -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	manifest is the file provided in the command line with switch "-M". manifest can contain nexe file name, log file name, 	nexe comamnd line (can contain up to 128 space delimited options). also manifest can contain any (key = value) pairs, for 	example it can be mapped file mapping (will be available in the next release). any switches cannot be duplicated with sel_ldr 	command line.
  * ver 5.3 2011-11-9 linux, x86, 64 working_sandbox_ver_5.3.7z makefile instead of bash build script (big thanks goes to camuel and oleg) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	fixes to get rid of compilation warnings: 		nacl_desc_base.c -- small change in define to avoid compiler warnings (marked with "d'b" comment) 		C:\1\trusted\validator\x86\nc_inst_bytes_tests.cc -- small syntax fixes 		C:\1\trusted\validator\x86\nc_remaining_memory_tests.cc -- small syntax fixes 		C:\1\trusted\validator\x86\halt_trim_tests.cc -- small syntax fixes 		C:\1\trusted\validator\x86\decoder\nc_inst_state_tests.cc -- small syntax fixes 		C:\1\trusted\validator\x86\decoder\gen\ncop_expr_node_kind.h -- small syntax fixes 		C:\1\trusted\validator\x86\decoder\gen\ncop_expr_node_flag.h -- small syntax fixes 		C:\1\trusted\validator\x86\decoder\gen\ncopcode_operand_flag.h -- small syntax fixes 		C:\1\trusted\validator\x86\decoder\gen\ncopcode_operand_kind.h -- small syntax fixes 		C:\1\trusted\validator\x86\decoder\gen\ncopcode_opcode_flags.h -- small syntax fixes 		C:\1\trusted\validator\x86\decoder\gen\ncopcode_insts.h -- small syntax fixes 		C:\1\trusted\validator\x86\decoder\gen\ncopcode_prefix.h -- small syntax fixes 		C:\1\shared\utils\debugging.h -- small syntax fixes
