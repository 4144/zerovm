  * version: new zerovm released. there are 2 flavors: zerovm 2 and
    zerovm 2* (compatible with old zerovm). main features of the version
    listed below. by default make will build zerovm 2* (compatible). to
    create zerovm 2 the compilation variable REMOVE_DEPRECATED should be
    defined
  * feature: opaque channel support. opaque channels use zbroker
    (for details see project https://github.com/zeromq/zbroker)
  * feature: untrusted elf loader. SEL (secure/simple elf loader inherited
    from nacl project) reworked and moved to untrusted side (see uboot.txt).
    also user allowed to provide own untrusted loader
  * feature: prototype of session storing/loading. the feature is under
    construction and can be removed or moved to untrusted side
  * feature: static linking. zerovm 2/2* can be linked statically. however
    it is not part of makefile yet, it is a script. when validator library
    will be changed to get rid of warnings this feature will be added to
    makefile
