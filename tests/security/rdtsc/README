rdtsc.nexe should not pass test with zerovm (or valz) and should pass 
with original nacl ncval

should look like
validator state = 1
daemon = 0
user return code = 0
etag(s) = disable
accounting = 0.00 0.00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
exit state = src/main/zerovm.c 146: validation failed
command = /home/bortoq/git/zerovm/zerovm[7702] rdtsc.manifest

update: for zerovm 2 uboot report will show:
validator state = 1
daemon = 0
user return code = 300
memtag = disabled
accounting = 0.00 0.00 4 488 0 0 0 0 0 0
exit state = ok
command = /home/bortoq/git/zerovm/zerovm[34490] rdtsc.manifest

where "user return code = 300" means "validation failed"
