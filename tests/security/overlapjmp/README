zerovm must show something like:

validator state = 1
daemon = 0
user return code = 0
etag(s) = disable
accounting = 0.00 0.00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
exit state = src/main/zerovm.c 146: validation failed
command = /home/bortoq/git/zerovm/zerovm[8399] overlapjmp.manifest

and valz will show:

update: zerovm 2 uboot will return error code and session will end with report:
validator state = 1
daemon = 0
user return code = 300
memtag = disabled
accounting = 0.00 0.00 4 600 0 0 0 0 0 0
exit state = ok
command = /home/bortoq/git/zerovm/zerovm[33641] overlapjmp.manifest

note: "user return code = 300" shows in which line the error encountered and
  it is line #300 with /* validation failed */ comment on it
