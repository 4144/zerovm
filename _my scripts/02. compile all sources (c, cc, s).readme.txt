in grabbed compilation strings "nativeclient" should be replaced
by sandbox root folder. for example "sandbox_hack":

/home/bigcrunch/nativeclient
/home/bigcrunch/sandbox_hack

also it would be better to change absolute pathes to relative
but very accurate because there are different types of includes:
  "system" pathes
  relative pathes from the sandbox root folder
  relative pathes from the current source file location

it would be nice to reduce "-I" options in gcc/g++ command lines. probbably
it can be obtained with includes changing
