todo:
this is example of a bad behavior: zvm must not crash with "segmentation fault", but 
show a message like "data execution is prohibited".

this issue must be fixed asap
update: it only can be fixed with appropriate handler which will intercept system handler for
"segmentation fault". the error caused by r/w data segment tryed to be executed
