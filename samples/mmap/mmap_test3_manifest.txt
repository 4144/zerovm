= by the way, manifest key/value are case sensitive
= generate random data and put it to file
= order of lines below doesn't matter, but it is more clear when put nexe name 1st, log 2nd, cmdline 3rd and only after that other keys

nexe = mmap_test3.c_x86_64.nexe
cmdline = mmap_test3.c 0

= maybe it would be better to rename "input" to "input.data" or contraversa: "http://input.data" to "http://input"
input = mmap_test3.c

= data can be mapped from rw opened file. so any changes in memory will change the file
datamap = mmap_test3.c
