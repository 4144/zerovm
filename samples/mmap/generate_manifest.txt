= generate random data and put it to file
= order of lines below doesn't matter, but it is more clear when put nexe name 1st, log 2nd, cmdline 3rd and only after that other keys

nexe = samples/mmap/mmap_test2.c_x86_64.nexe
=log = samples/mmap/mmap_test2.log
=cmdline = http://samples/mmap/input.data

= maybe it would be better to rename "input" to "input.data" or contraversa: "http://input.data" to "http://input"
input = samples/mmap/mmap_test2.c

= i put it just for test purposes
