version without syscalls
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2nd version of sandbox. some of syscalls still left untouched because they work in process of load/exit nexe.
    without them (or part of them) nexe cannot be loaded and cannot be run (for example we will always get
    "segmentation fault" w/o exit syscall)

    there are no binaries in the archive. only sources and scripts

    sel_ldr - compiled sandbox. this version differ from the original (most of syscalls are absent)

    building scripts are fixed. extra "-I" options were removed. all absolute pathes changed to relative.
    all libraries will be placed to one temporary folder. after sandbox compilation all intermediate
    files (*.a, *.o) will be deleted.     script "build_all.sh" was added (now whole build process can
    be done in one keystroke).

    todo:

    yet more simplify directory structure (1st of all completely remove "scons_out" and make one folder for intermediate files)

    to solve problem with warnings (syscalls were not completely removed, just disables). now i see
    warnings "defined but not used" due compilation. "02._compile_all_sources.sh" should be changed.
    if solved i have to put back "-Werror" option (treat warnings as errors).

    to remove "step 1": "01._make_output_folders.sh" since we need additional folders no more (except only one)

working_sandbox_ver_1.7z
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1st version (finally working!) of sandbox. there are binaries in the archive
    (object files, libraries and sel_ldr itself)

    sel_ldr - compiled sandbox. right now it has no changes comparing to original (google nacl) version

    todo:

    pathes in compilation scripts are absolute. i have in plans to change them to relative.

    there is one another problem: linker command line needs to be rewritten. i added
    a new -L???? to link sel_ldr with sandbox libraries, now all libs should be
    placed to one dir instead of being taken from original locations.


GLOBAL TODO
    write code to allow sandbox take some switches from the configuration
    "sel_ldr_x86.h" contain definition of "NACL_THREAD_MAX". move it to configuration
