ABOUT:
ZeroVM is a simple virtual machine.
ZeroVM can run (and isolate) 64-bit x86 applications in a 32-bit address space.
ZeroVM works under Linux x86_64.

0. Get ZeroVM from github: https://github.com/Dazo-org/zerovm
   or as archive: https://github.com/Dazo-org/zerovm/zipball/master
1. Install prerequisites:
   sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl1.2-dev texinfo libcrypto++-dev libssl-dev m4  
1.1. Install sqlite-autoconf
   wget http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-autoconf-3071200.tar.gz
   tar xvfz sqlite-autoconf-3071200.tar.gz
   cd sqlite-autoconf-3071200/
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
   sudo ldconfig
1.2. Install zeromq & packages required by zeromq
  sudo apt-get install uuid-dev
  wget http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-2.2.0.tar.gz
  tar xvfz zeromq-2.2.0.tar.gz
  cd zeromq-2.2.0

QUICKSTART

==================PRELIMINARY===================================================
Quickstart for installing ZeroVM on Ubuntu

 cd ~
 mkdir zerovm_getting_started
 cd zerovm_getting_started
 wget https://github.com/Dazo-org/zerovm/zipball/master
 unzip master
 rm -rf master 
 cd zerovm_getting_started
 sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl1.2-dev texinfo libcrypto++-dev libssl-dev m4 lib32z1
 mkdir obj
 mkdir test
 make

Now if you've got RUN OK PASSED messages that everything is fine and you have ZeroVM compiled for your platform! 

Let's try to run ZeroVM

 ./zerovm

You should see a usage message.

ZEROVM SDK INSTALL:

You need to obtain an SDK in order to build samples and your own programs for ZeroVM. 
To download and install the SDK you need to consult the following page 
(you can install the SDK in separate terminal window): 
https://developers.google.com/native-client/sdk/download. 

For me it was (in a new terminal window):
 cd ~/zerovm_getting_started
 mkdir sdk 
 cd sdk 
 wget http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/nativeclient-mirror/nacl/nacl_sdk/nacl_sdk.zip 
 unzip nacl_sdk.zip 
 cd nacl_sdk 
 ./naclsdk list
 ./naclsdk update

Now you can use the newly installed custom GNU toolchain to build the attached samples or your own programs



Troubleshooting:
1.
- ... Fatal error: can't create obj/sel_main.o: No such file or directory
- missing subfolders in the ZeroVM folder. create 2 directories: "obj/" and "test/"

2. 
- ... error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before ‘AES_KEY’
- missing library. look at (2) of Installation chapter and issue the given command
