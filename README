working_sandbox_ver_1.7z
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1st version (finally working!) of sandbox. there are binaries in the archive
    (object files, libraries and sel_ldr itself)

    sel_ldr - compiled sandbox. right now it has no changes comparing to original (google nacl) version

    todo:

    pathes in compilation scripts are absolute. i have in plans to change them to relative.

    there is one another problem: linker command line needs to be rewritten. i added
    a new -L???? to link sel_ldr with sandbox libraries, now all libs should be
    placed to one dir instead of being taken from original locations.


GLOBAL TODO
    write code to allow sandbox take some switches from the configuration
    "sel_ldr_x86.h" contain definition of "NACL_THREAD_MAX". move it to configuration
