ABOUT:
ZeroVM is a simple virtual machine.
ZeroVM can run (and isolate) 64-bit x86 applications in a 32-bit address space.
ZeroVM works under Linux x86_64.
For more information check http://zerovm.org


INSTALL:

Everything tested on Ubuntu 10.04 and Ubuntu 12.04. No issues with VMWare Player. 
VirtualBox doesn't support SSE4.1 used by several of provided samples.

1. Prerequisites
1.1. Install ordinary prerequisites:
   sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl1.2-dev texinfo libcrypto++-dev libssl-dev m4 lib32z1 uuid-dev

1.2. add to ~/.bashrc
   put your home directory name instead of "~"
   export NACL_SDK_ROOT=~/nacl_sdk/pepper_23
   export ZEROVM_ROOT=~/git/zerovm
   export ZRT_ROOT=~/git/zrt

1.3. Install zeromq & packages required by zeromq
   cd ~
   wget http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-2.2.0.tar.gz
   tar xvfz zeromq-2.2.0.tar.gz
   cd zeromq-2.2.0
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
   cd ..

1.4. Install NaCl SDK. Consult https://developers.google.com/native-client/sdk/download for exact procedure. Below should work okay in most cases.
   cd ~
   wget http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/nativeclient-mirror/nacl/nacl_sdk/nacl_sdk.zip 
   unzip nacl_sdk.zip 
   cd nacl_sdk 
   ./naclsdk list
   ./naclsdk update
   cd ..

   Now you can use the newly installed custom GNU toolchain to build the attached samples or your own programs

2. Installing ZeroVM
2.1. Console installation (not needed if compiling from eclipse):
   cd ~
   wget https://github.com/zerovm/zerovm/zipball/master
   unzip master
   mkdir zerovm
   mv zerovm-zerovm-#######/* zerovm/
   cd zerovm
   make
   sudo ldconfig
   cd ..
2.2. Eclispe CDT installation
   If your system doesn't have JRE, install recent JRE. 
   Download Eclipse CDT from eclipse download site. No installation necessary, just unpack and run executable.
   Download and install Egit plugin for eclipse
   Point Egit to git://github.com/zerovm/zerovm.git and pull the recent ZeroVM sources.
   Select 'creare C/C++ project from makefile" to create new eclipse project
   Run the makefile to build the project and run unit tests

   If everything is ok you will see output of unit tests. You can find "zerovm" executable in zerovm folder. Now if you've got RUN OK PASSED messages that everything is fine and you have ZeroVM compiled for your platform! 

3. Running ZeroVM and samples

   cd ~/zerovm
   ./zerovm

   You should see a usage message.
   Consider building and running samples located in samples directory.

   notice: some of samples can be found in tests/functional/ but more of them resides in the
   zrt project

   about missing ncval and ncval_stubout see Troubleshooting(3) 

Troubleshooting:
1.
problem: Fatal error: can't create obj/sel_main.o: No such file or directory
solution: missing subfolders in the ZeroVM folder. create 2 directories: "obj/" and "test/"

2. 
problem: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before ‘AES_KEY’
solution: missing library. look at (2) of Installation chapter and issue the given command

3.
problem: exit state = src/main/sel_main.c 156: cannot start validator
solution: put in "ncval" path (ncval can be found in zerovm/lib/bin)
problem: exit state = src/main/sel_main.c 162: validation failed
solution: put in "ncval_stubout" path (ncval_stubout can be found in zerovm/lib/bin)
  if the problem remains try to find out exact source of problem using ncval
