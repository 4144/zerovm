ABOUT:
ZeroVM is a simple virtual machine.
ZeroVM can run (and isolate) 64-bit x86 applications in a 32-bit address space.
ZeroVM works under Linux x86_64.
For more information check http://zerovm.org


INSTALL:

Everything tested on Ubuntu 10.04 and Ubuntu 12.04. No issues with VMWare Player. 
VirtualBox doesn't support SSE4.1 used by several of provided samples.

1. Prerequisites
1.1. Install ordinary prerequisites:
   sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl1.2-dev texinfo libcrypto++-dev libssl-dev m4 lib32z1 uuid-dev

1.2. Install sqlite-autoconf
   cd ~
   wget http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-autoconf-3071200.tar.gz
   tar xvfz sqlite-autoconf-3071200.tar.gz
   cd sqlite-autoconf-3071200/
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
   sudo ldconfig
   cd ..

1.3. Install zeromq & packages required by zeromq
   cd ~
   wget http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-2.2.0.tar.gz
   tar xvfz zeromq-2.2.0.tar.gz
   cd zeromq-2.2.0
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
   cd ..

1.4. Install NaCl SDK. Consult https://developers.google.com/native-client/sdk/download for exact procedure. Below should work okay in most cases.
   cd ~
   wget http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/nativeclient-mirror/nacl/nacl_sdk/nacl_sdk.zip 
   unzip nacl_sdk.zip 
   cd nacl_sdk 
   ./naclsdk list
   ./naclsdk update
   cd ..

   Now you can use the newly installed custom GNU toolchain to build the attached samples or your own programs

2. Installing ZeroVM
2.1. Console installation (not needed if compiling from eclipse):
   cd ~
   wget https://github.com/Dazo-org/zerovm/zipball/master
   unzip master
   mkdir zerovm
   mv Dazo-blah-blah-blah/* zerovm/
   cd zerovm
   make
   sudo ldconfig
   cd ..
2.2. Eclispe CDT installation
   If your system doesn't have JRE, install recent JRE. 
   Download Eclipse CDT from eclipse download site. No installation necessary, just unpack and run executable.
   Download and install Egit plugin for eclipse
   Point Egit to git://github.com/Dazo-org/zerovm.git and pull the recent version of ZeroVM sources.
   Select 'creare C/C++ project from makefile" to create new eclipse project
   Run the makefile to build the project and run unit tests

   If everything is ok you will see output of unit tests. You can find "zerovm" executable in zerovm folder. Now if you've got RUN OK PASSED messages that everything is fine and you have ZeroVM compiled for your platform! 

3. Running ZeroVM and samples

   cd ~/zerovm
   ./zerovm

   You should see a usage message.
   Consider building and running samples located in samples directory.

Troubleshooting:
1.
- ... Fatal error: can't create obj/sel_main.o: No such file or directory
- missing subfolders in the ZeroVM folder. create 2 directories: "obj/" and "test/"

2. 
- ... error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before ‘AES_KEY’
- missing library. look at (2) of Installation chapter and issue the given command
