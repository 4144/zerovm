This document describes ZeroVM daemon mode
(up to date 2013-11-08, needs editing)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
starting from build 2013-11-08 zerovm can be started as daemon. only purpose
of current implementation of daemon mode is reducing latency. some programs
has very long startup time

each request received by the daemon will immediately spawn child zerovm
session which works as usual with some exclusions:
1. a new manifest should be valid and contain same channels aliases (uris can
   differ) with same fields. following keywords will be ignored (but shell
   present): Memory, Program, Version.
2. all data written until zvm_fork() will be lost. all sequential channels keep
   their positions (and sequential channels reached eof will be unavailable)
3. zerovm daemon created with network channel behavior undefined
4. report of spawned session can only be placed to control channel provided by
   Job in manifest

known issues:
1. daemon mode zerovm (daemon) releases forked processes in wait status when
get command through command channel. therefore some finished and not yet
released sessions will be seen as zombies
