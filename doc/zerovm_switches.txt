     (testing flags)
     -s skip validation
     -F fuzz testing; quit after loading NaCl app
     -S disable signal handling
     -Q disable platform qualification (dangerous!)


-M -- The manifest contains a set of control data for the executable. Obligatory switch.
      More details about the manifest file can be found in the appropriate document on 
      github.com/Dazo-org/ZeroVM

-v -- controls verbosity of information in the ZeroVM log. writes ZeroVM 
      log to "var/log/syslog". it is not recommended to use values more than 2

-s -- skips validation. used for "prevalidation" engine.

-F -- specified NaCl application will be loaded but not run. used for 
      "prevalidation" engine.

-S -- will prevent the signals handlers installation. not recommended to use.

-Q -- will skip data execution test. This switch makes it possible to run ZeroVM 
      application on a platform with no "data execution" protection.
