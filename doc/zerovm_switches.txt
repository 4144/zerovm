this document describes ZeroVM command line switches
----------------------------------------------------

ZeroVM command line switches:

        Usage: sel_ldr [-h d:D] [-r d:D] [-w d:D] [-i d:D]
                         [-l log_file] [-v d] [-X d]
                         [-M manifest_file] [-cFgIsQ]
*       -h
*       -r
*       -w associate a host POSIX descriptor D with app desc d
           that was opened in O_RDWR, O_RDONLY, and O_WRONLY modes
           respectively
*       -i associates an IMC handle D with app desc d
        -v <level> verbosity
*       -X create a bound socket and export the address via an
           IMC message to a corresponding NaCl app descriptor
           (use -1 to create the bound socket / address descriptor
           pair, but that no export via IMC should occur)
           (testing flags)
        -c ignore validator! dangerous! Repeating this option twice skips
           validation completely.
        -F fuzz testing; quit after loading NaCl app
        -S enable signal handling.
**      -g enable gdb debug stub.
        -l <file>  write log output to the given file
        -s safely stub out non-validating instructions
        -Q disable platform qualification (dangerous!)
	      -M <file> load settings from manifest

* these switches will be removed in the nearest future
** under construction


switches explanation:

-v -- controls amount of information in the ZeroVM log
-c -- if specified once - report valiation status and ignore it
      if specified twice - skip validation
-s -- enable 2nd pass of validator (by default ZeroVM makes only one pass)
-F -- specified NaCl application will not run, only loaded (usefull for validation)
-Q -- will skip data execution test. with this switch it is possible to run ZeroVM on platform without
      "data execution" protection.
-M -- specifies manifest file. manifest contain set of control data for user application
      more details about manifest can be read in the appropriate document at github.com/Dazo-org/ZeroVM
