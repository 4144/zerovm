----------------------------------------------------

ZeroVM command line switches:

  ZeroVM tag1 lightweight VM manager, build 2013-09-20
  Usage: <manifest> [-l#] [-v#] [-stFPQ]

   -l <gigabytes> file size limit (default 4Gb)
   -s skip validation
   -t report to log instead of stdout
   -v <0..3> log verbosity (default 0)
   -F quit right before starting user session
   -P disable channels space preallocation
   -Q disable platform qualification


   -- The manifest contains a set of control data for the executable. Obligatory.
      More details about the manifest file can be found in the appropriate document on 
      github.com/ZeroVM/ZeroVM

-l -- changes zerovm i/o hard limit. by default session only allowed to use 4gb
      value should be in gigabytes 

-s -- skips validation. used for "prevalidation" engine.

-t -- specifies report mode. valid arguments <0..2> 
      0 - put final report into /dev/stdout (default)
      1 - put final report into syslog
      2 - enable fast reports and put it with final report into /dev/stdout

-v -- controls verbosity of information in the ZeroVM log. writes ZeroVM 
      log to "var/log/syslog". it is not recommended to use values more than 2
      possible values are <0..3>

-F -- specified NaCl application will be loaded but not run. used for 
      "prevalidation" engine.

-P -- if specified zerovm will not allocate space for "write" channels connected
      to local storage

-Q -- will skip data execution test. This switch makes it possible to run ZeroVM 
      application on a platform with no "data execution" protection.
      
examples:
  zerovm -v2 test.manifest
  starts zerovm with manifest "test.manifest" and "debug" verbosity
  
  zerovm -QPst test.manifest
  starts zerovm with manifest "test.manifest" skipping validation, storage
  preallocation, platform qualification. report will be put into syslog
  
  zerovm -F test.manifest
  loads program specified in "test.manifest" and exits with validator status
