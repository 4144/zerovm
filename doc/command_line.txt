----------------------------------------------------

ZeroVM command line switches:

  ZeroVM tag1 lightweight VM manager, build 2013-10-27
  Usage: <manifest> [-v#] [-stFPQ]

   -s skip validation
   -t <0..3> report to stdout/log/fast (default 0)
   -v <0..3> log verbosity (default 0)
   -F quit right before starting user session
   -P disable channels space preallocation
   -Q disable platform qualification
   -T enable trap calls tracing


   -- The manifest contains a set of control data for the executable. Obligatory.
      More details about the manifest file can be found in the appropriate document on 
      github.com/ZeroVM/ZeroVM

-s -- skips validation. used for "prevalidation" engine.

-t -- specifies report mode. valid arguments <0..2> 
      0 - put final report into /dev/stdout (default)
      1 - put final report into syslog
      3 - put final report into path specified by "Job" in manifest
      note 1: the switch is still under construction (and can be removed in a future)
      note 2: "-t2" is not supported

-v -- controls verbosity of information in the ZeroVM log. writes ZeroVM 
      log to "var/log/syslog". it is not recommended to use values more than 2
      possible values are <0..3>

-F -- specified NaCl application will be loaded but not run. used for 
      "prevalidation" engine.

-P -- if specified zerovm will not allocate space for "write" channels connected
      to local storage

-Q -- will skip data execution test. This switch makes it possible to run ZeroVM 
      application on a platform with no "data execution" protection.
      
-T -- enable tracing of the session. all trap calls, some of zerovm internal
      calls and user code invocations will be logged in file specified by this
      option. file should have absolute path (also see ztrace.txt) 
      
notes:
- tag1 after ZeroVM means encoding used for zerovm. tag0: md5, tag1: sha-1,
  tag2: sha-256. encoding can be specified before zerovm compilation through
  Makefile variable "TAG_ENCRYPTION".

- -t3 should not be used. this value reserved for sessions spawned by zerovm
  in daemon mode
  
- in old zerovm versions manifest was passed with "-M" option. the option still
  supported but marked obsolete and should not be used  
      
examples:
  zerovm -v2 test.manifest
  starts zerovm with manifest "test.manifest" and "debug" verbosity
  
  zerovm -QPst test.manifest
  starts zerovm with manifest "test.manifest" skipping validation, storage
  preallocation, platform qualification. report will be put into syslog
  
  zerovm -F test.manifest
  loads program specified in "test.manifest" and exits with validator status
