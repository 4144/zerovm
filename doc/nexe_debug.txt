This document will be updated as soon as gdb could be used for nexe debugging.

For now user can debug NaCl application by using log (in available in manifest)

update:
it is possible now to use gdb from the gnu toolchain with script:

set confirm off
b NaClCreateMainThread
r
c
b main
add-symbol-file <module name> 0x440a00020000
c

where <module name> the file name of the user program compiled with zerovm toolchain
note: the module must have debug information (can be turned of with the -g compile option)
