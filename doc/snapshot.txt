ZeroVM session snapshot description
(up to date 2014-04-24, needs editing)
---------------------------

ZeroVM has ability to store session "on the fly" and restore it later. for
now snapshot can only be initiated by untrusted code request. there are plans
to allow snapshot from outside by signal or by request from "command channel"
(design is not ready yet)

snapshot is the image of session. the image consist of fllowing files:
channels -- information about channels (see channels.txt)
context -- untrusted context (untrusted registers)
dump -- untrusted memory dump
map -- untrusted memory map (protection of each page)

for now if ZeroVM gets "." in manifest "Program" value it will try to read all
necessary data from the current directory. "." will be upgraded to image file
path soon. if stored session data loaded successfully ZeroVM sets other
settings and pass control to the untrusted code where it was stopped
