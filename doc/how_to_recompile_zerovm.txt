This document describes how to recompile ZeroVM after changing 
compilation options
(up to date 2014-06-06, needs editing)
(this is temporary document. can be removed after makefiles / scripts
will be fixed)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
ZeroVM has uboot (default untrusted elf loader) which included to ZeroVM
binary as data. ZeroVM also has "compatibility mode" introduced to make
ZeroVM 2 run old ZeroVM 1 nexes and use the old format manifests. there
is possibility to create 2 flavors of ZeroVM 2: "ZeroVM 2*" (compatible)
and "ZeroVM 2".

build "ZeroVM 2*" (compatible)
1. cd $ZEROVM_ROOT/tests/functional/include
2. make clean all
3. cd $ZEROVM_ROOT/tests/functional/demo/uboot
4. make clean all (ignore errors if will be)
5. cp uboot.inc $ZEROVM_ROOT/src/loader/uboot.inc
6. cd $ZEROVM_ROOT
7. make clean debug (will run tests)
   or
   make clean all (will build release version)

"ZeroVM 2"
sequence just the same, but in all makefiles should be added
"-DREMOVE_DEPRECATED" to compilation switched. it should include:
ZeroVM Makefile
zvmlib Makefile
uboot Makefile
all tests Makefiles

to do:
REMOVE_DEPRECATED should be specified in ZeroVM Makefile in command line
and than should be passed from there to zvmlib, uboot and tests. ZeroVM
Makefile should be modified to contain appropriate logic to make and copy
uboot inc-file to ZeroVM src folder (and better place should be found
for uboot sources)
