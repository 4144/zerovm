this document contain short description of nacl syscalls
--------------------------------------------------------

nacl application does not allowed to use real system calls, instead of that
user can use nacl syscalls. there is however, difference between original
nacl sel_ldr and zerovm: zerovm does not support syscalls except 
NACL_sys_sysbrk (20), NACL_sys_mmap (21), NACL_sys_munmap (22), NACL_sys_exit (30),
NACL_sys_mutex_create (70), NACL_sys_tls_init (82), NACL_sys_tls_get (84). also,
zerovm support special syscall trap (0) (see "trap.txt")

when zerovm encounter not supporting syscall it ignores such syscall.

for input/output syscall zerovm offer replacement: pagination engine (see 
"pagination.txt"). for syscalls getting time/date there is special attribute
in manifest: TimeStamp. user application can get it using zvm_setup() from
zerovm api.

more detailed information about syscalls can be obtained from google nacl paper.

user program allowed to intercept all syscalls except trap() (for further information
see "syscallback.txt"). this is the way to emulate some (or all) nacl syscalls.

syscalls can be used by user directly (via trampoline) or indirectly by using nacl sdk.
sample of how to invoke nacl syscall directly can be found in "samples/direct_syscalls".
