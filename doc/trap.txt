(up to date 2013-10-20, needs editing)
------------------------------

Trap is a syscall number 0 from trampoline and the only available syscall 
(nacl syscalls not supported anymore). This syscall accepts 1 argument:
uint64_t* and returns an int32_t value.

Trap argument (can be treated as array of uint32_t) has the following structure:
arg[0] == function number (element of TrapCalls enum from "zvm.h")
arg[1] == reserved (not used)
arg[2] .. arg[N] = arguments to this function

trap() supports the following functions:
  TrapRead
  TrapWrite
  TrapProt
  TrapExit
  TrapFork
