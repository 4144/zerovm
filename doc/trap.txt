This document describes the trap() call
------------------------------

Trap is a part of zerovm. In the future trap will completely replace 
the native NaCl syscall engine, except call forwarding part, a "trampoline"
(see Google NaCl paper).

Trap is a syscall number 0. Since nacl sdk knows nothing about
syscall number 0, trap() is decorated as a pointer to a function with absolute
address in the trampoline space (0x10000). This syscall accepts 1 argument:
uint64_t* and returns an int32_t value.

Trap argument (can be treated as array of uint32_t) has the following structure:
arg[0] == function number (element of TrapCalls enum from "zvm.h")
arg[1] == reserved (not used)
arg[2] .. arg[N] = arguments to this function

For now trap() supports the following functions:
  TrapRead
  TrapWrite
  TrapSyscallback
  TrapChannels
  TrapChannelName
  TrapAttributes
  TrapSyscallsCount
  TrapSyscallsLimit
  TrapMemSize
  TrapHeapPtr
  TrapExit
  
for the further information regarding trap functions see "api.txt"

Notice: NaCl syscall NaClSysExit() currently uses TrapExit
