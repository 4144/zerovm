this files contain details about new validator from the latest
nacl version (currently 8428, taken from "DEPS")
--------------------------------------------------------------

preparation:
same old files were taken from the new nacl validator folders
pathes in #includes were changed to zerovm ones (see "patch_includes.cmd")

added files:
src/validator/cpufeatures.h
src/validator/validation_cache.h

replaced files in other (than "validator*") folders:
src/service_runtime/sel_validate_image.c

fixed files:
sel_ldr.c (added initialization for a new fields)
sel_ldr.h (a new fields added)
sel_main.c (a two new command line switches were added -Z -D)
nacl_switch_to_app_64.c (NaClInitSwitchToApp() replaced with a new version)
Makefile (2 compilation units were removed)
.. also a lot of warnings (extra ';' and extra ',') were fixed


note: in order to make unit test "x86_decoder_tests_nc_inst_state" working
i had to add a large new header "validator/x86/decoder/gen/nc_opcode_table_64.h"
