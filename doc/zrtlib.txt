This document describes zerovm runtime library
----------------------------------------------

ZRT is an untrusted code library. this is the helper code written over trap() and syscallback.
With ZRT the user program can use most of standard c functions. ZRT makes available ZeroVM channels:
0 as stdin, 1 as stdout, 2 as stderr (user is not allowed to (re)open or close these channels); 
2, 3 e.t.c. as a network channels. in order to use ZRT user program should include "api/zvm.h" and 
link against libzrt.a

ZRT replaces following NaCl syscalls:
NACL_sys_read
NACL_sys_write
NACL_sys_lseek
NACL_sys_stat
NACL_sys_fstat
NACL_sys_gettimeofday

ZRT forward syscalls to trusted code
NACL_sys_sysbrk
NACL_sys_mmap
NACL_sys_munmap
NACL_sys_exit
NACL_sys_tls_get
NACL_sys_second_tls_get

for other NaCl syscalls ZRT returns 0 or error code (if syscall is forbidden)

 also ZRT contains accessor functions over the user_manifest object. All those functions are
 read-only except zvm_set_syscallback() which could be used to set or clear a syscallback. Full 
 list of the user_manifest accessors could be found in "api/zvm.h".
