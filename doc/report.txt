This document describes ZeroVM report
(up to date 2014-06-06, needs editing)

session report informs about the session results. the report is mostly
needed for integration (now used by zerovm project swift middleware).
report has two flavors: release and debug. here are examples of reports

update:
ZeroVM 2* (compatible) if built with debug information will show "etag(s)"
instead of "memtag". however it can contain only memory etag 

debug report:
validator state = 0
daemon = 0
user return code = 0
memtag = 34010ca11e2a98f23b8f3a95da90926b48a8848a
accounting = 0.00 0.10 7 44144 14 22825 0 0 0 0
exit state = ok
command = /home/bortoq/git/zerovm/zerovm[18394] accounting.manifest -s2

release report:
0
0
0
34010ca11e2a98f23b8f3a95da90926b48a8848a
0.01 0.08 7 44144 14 22825 0 0 0 0
ok

explanation of report lines:
1. state of validator. contains number of validation errors. 0 means all
   validations of untrusted code were successfull
2. daemon mode. if 0 the session is just regular session. if 1 - session
   was converted to daemon mode
3. user return code. 64-bit value returned by untrusted code via zvm_exit()
4. memory tag. checksum of whole (available) untrusted memory
5. accounting. i/o and time expenses of untrusted code. namely:
   1. real time spent in untrusted code
   2. i/o time (spent in system)
   3. number of local reads
   4. number of local bytes were read
   5. number of local writes
   6. number of local bytes were written
   7. number of remote reads
   8. number of remote bytes were read
   9. number of remote writes
   10. number of remote bytes were written
6. session status. if session terminated without errors it is "ok". otherwise
   it contains the short description of problem
7. (debug report only) command line. contains the session command line with pid
   (of zerovm process) in brakets

NOTE: report can be written in
  - /dev/stdout
  - syslog
  - unix domain socket (for sessions forked by daemon mode zerovm)
  by default report will appear in console. the report output can be set by -t
  command line switch (see command_line.txt)
